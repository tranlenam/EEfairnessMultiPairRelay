# Energy Efficiency Fairness for Multi-Pair Wireless-Powered Relaying System

This capsule contains the code for the following scientific paper:

Kien-Giang Nguyen, Quang-Doanh Vu,  Le-Nam Tran, and Markku Juntti, "Energy Efficiency Fairness for Multi-Pair Wireless-Powered Relaying Systems," IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun., vol. 37, no. 2, pp. 357-373, Feb. 2019.

## Instructions
The "**main_EEFairness_EHRelay_OW.m**" makes use of [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io/) as a parser and [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as the internal convex conic solver for speed. Code Ocean automatically provides these packages (see environment/postInstall). You can download the code and run it your local machine, but you need to manually install these packages yourself. You can substitute MOSEK with any convex conic solver such as SDPT3, Sedumi, Gurobi, Cplex, to name a few.
